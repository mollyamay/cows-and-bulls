# cows-and-bulls
Plays a guessing game with the user

This progeam plays the “cows and bulls” game with the user. The game works like this:
Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. For every digit that the
user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”. For every digit the user guessed
correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.” Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many
“cows” and “bulls” they have. Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over. 

Say the number generated by the computer is 1038. An example interaction could look like this:
  Welcome to the Cows and Bulls Game!
  Enter a number:
  
  1234
  
  2 cows, 0 bulls
  
  1286
  
  1 cow, 1 bull
  
  **this program has a bug that comes up if the user guesses repeated digits. These will show up as multiple
    bulls even if the answer only contains one instance of the number.
